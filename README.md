# Cache_Implementation
Simulation of a Direct-Mapped Cache and Set Associative Cache in python  


## Execution Instructions
- ```chmod +x IMT2019525.sh```
- ```./IMT2019525```


## System Requirements  
- Jupyter Notebook(to run the .ipynb file)
- ```matplotlib``` and ```numpy```(to simulate the observations)
- Preferrably Python3.6+(to run the .py files)
- ```chmod``` or equivalent(to run the .sh file)

## Contributing  
Please feel free to send PRs! Please include relevant comments in your commit(s).  

### Current Issues and Enhancements:
- Generating a pandas dataframe for the hit/miss rates  
- Cache Replacement Algorithm used is not good enough   
- GUI to show the cache contents in real time using ```tkinter```
